3. The program gets stuck and has to be terminated.

5. -1

6. if (openReadFile == -1) {
                
                
7. perror("There was an error opening the read file\n");

8. 

9. There was an error opening the read file
:No such file or directory

10. There was an error opening the read file
: Permission denied

11. 
open: -1 if error; yes
close: -1 if error; yes;
read: -1 if error; yes
write: -1 if error; yes
printf: negative value if error; no

12. This lets the developer know what the type of error is and how to correct it easily. 
The program will not quit or crash.
