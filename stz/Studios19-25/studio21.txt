It returns IP addresses. Also gives different domain hosts.

7. It is useful to have multiple IP addresses to one host name for high level load balancing. slu.edu gets a lot of traffic and 
this will be able to handle heavy traffic.

Physical layer: USB - this defines the cables and connectors used in a bus for connection and communication between 
computers. This is physical because it is physical organization and uses no software and is merely a way to 
help with communication. 

Data Link layer: CDP is a protocol that is used to share information about other 
directly connected equipment. This is something that shares data between two devices 
and is not the physical component. 

Network layer: Connectionless-mode Network Service (CLNS) can transmit data 
without requiring a circuit. This routes messages to the destination without 
depending on other messages. Because it communicates with other computer networks, 
it is considered part of the network layer. 

Transport Layer: AppleTalk Echo Protocol (AEP) is networking protocols which allow 
local networks to be connected with no setup or router or server. This transmits data without any centralized 
servers and does not rely solely on the network. 

Session Layer: Network Basic Input/Output System (NetBIOS) allows applications 
on separate computers to communicate over a local area network. 

Presentation Layer: Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides communications 
security over a computer network. This secure all communications between their servers and web browsers. 

Application Layer: Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is used to assign AP addresses 
to network devices from a configuration servers. This works for applications because when applications are turned on 
then it can request for an IP address.
