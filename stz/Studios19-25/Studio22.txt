2. 9 bits

3.

111011001
111111110
000000000

4. Flipping one bit will not catch all errors; this is will not match the parity bit. If one of the 8 bits is flipped, the parity 
bit will not match, and if the parity bit is flipped, then it will not match. It will always catch error.

5. Flipping two bits means that it may look right, but it does not match right. It will not always catch this error. 

6. It will catch an error if an odd number of bits is flipped. It fails then. 

7. 38 bytes

8. 138 bytes long. 38/138 = 27.5% overhead 

9. 1538 bytes long. 38/1538 = 2.47% overhead
