2.  printf("%s\n", linString);
    printf("%s\n", winString);

4.  int i;
    for (i = 0; i < linSize; i++)
    { printf("%c\n", linString[i]); }
	
5. It points to the very first character inside the winString, which is W.

6. W was printed out

7. I is stored after the first character of winString. 

8.  for (i = 0; i < 8; i++)
    { printf("%c\n",*(winString + i)); }
	
9. The output prints everything after each pointer arithmetic value.

11. I get a segmentation fault error because the pointer is a read-only memory and I cannot change parts of what it holds.
