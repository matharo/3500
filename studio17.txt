6. it spends 300,000 cycles on misses, and 90,000 cycles on hits. it spends 390,000 total cycles on memory accesses
7. 3.9 cycles average number of cycles
8. 290,000 total cycles, 2.9 average number of cycles per access
9. since this is an alternative, the miss still uses 30 cycles:
	total cycles is 119,000. average is 1.19 cycles per access
10. the 2nd alternative is better because you reduce the percentage of misses, which overall will reduce the total cycles and average cycles
the 2nd is better by: 171000 cycles, by 1.71 average cycles
option 1 is 2.43 times worse than option 2 -- total and average cycles
on the other sense, option 2 is 40% better than option 1
