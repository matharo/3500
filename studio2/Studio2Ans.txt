2) It copies each line of text when you hit enter

3) It copied everything inside the file to the terminal


4) we wrote into a file on the terminal


5) It basically did the same thing as ‘>’


6) read() - #include <unistd.h>
   write() - #include <unistd.h>


8) On success, the number of bytes read is returned and zero indicates end of the file. The return value type is int.


9) The behavior matches up until the buffer value/ size whereas cat reads the entire file.

10) By increasing the buffer size will affect the correctness of the program. If the buffer size is very small, then little information is printed to the terminal. The bufferSize = 10 gave an output of Retrieved . With size 2 only Re was outputted. For size 15000, the entire mars message was printed plus whatever was in memory due to buffer size being larger than the byte size. 


11) Small buffer size doesn’t provide the entire text and is very limited whereas a large buffer size gives unnecessary data from memory.
