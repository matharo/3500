4. The return values are the PID of the child process is returned in the parent and 0 is returned in the child. On failure, -1 is returned in the parent, and no child process is created. 

5. 
I am the parent 12986
I am the child 12987

6. The child pid gets printed much later than the parent which is unexpected (though makes sense because of sleep()), but the child's pid is still 1 more than the parent's (parent pid = 13131, child pid = 13132) which does make sense because the child process was still running the entire time. 

7. The program executes just like it did when we added sleep(3)
