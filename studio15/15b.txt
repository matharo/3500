studio 15b - paging

2. it has 262144 page frames (each 2^18 bytes) with each page size 4kb

3. 6 bytes 

since a 32bit can have 1 million pages and 64bit has way more than 1 million, then a 48 bit address can hold the median of the two amount of pages. 

4. resides in page 3, offset is 2308 because page starts at 8192 bytes so offset is 10500 mod 8192
 
5. 0x43904 hex

6. 3750000 page faults, because 15gb = 15000000, and there are 4kb pages

7. 468750 page faults 

8. small pages: smaller programs can run faster and not have an excess amount of memory allocated for them.
large pages: you can run larger programs without having to divide them up and put them in separate parts of memory 

9. moving data from the computer disk to memory takes 2^1 bytes less to move from disk to memory
