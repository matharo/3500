studio 16	page tables

2. there are 262144 page frames

3. 1048576 page frames 

4. the system will have to call on the OS for more memory which will eat into the memory that contains the OS, so the system will indeed crash

5. the max would be the answer in number 3 because theoretically the max number would be however many pages there are which is on the virtual memory 

6. 4mb because assuming each page is 4bytes, 2^32/2^12 * 4 = 4mb, 4096kb

7. 4kb pages, 1 GB of ram for - bits of virtual address 32-bit to specify page number

8. 20 bits specifies page number. 12 bits are the offset --of a 32 bit virtual address

9. physical address will contain 30 bits

10. 18 bits

11. 18 bits = page frame, 12 bits = offset

12. page 0000
13. page 0010 and page 0101
14. 8 bits in virtual address, 7.5 bits in physical address
15. 101110001111000
16. 01011110000111
