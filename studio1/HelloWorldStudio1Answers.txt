Hello World Program

Files: hello_fprintf.c, hello_write.c

#include <stdio.h>			//number 2

//number 3
printf() takes a constant character
fprintf() takes an output stream and then a string/constant character


//number 4
The difference between printf() and fprintf() is that
printf() writes to the stdout standard output stream
fprintf() writes to a given output stream

//number 5	
OUTPUT: Hello, World!

//number 6
section number 2


//number 7
#include <unistd.h>

//number 8

//number 9	
OUTPUT (when size is 13): Hello, World

//number 10
Foreign characters get added on after the new line
This happens because write() is printing out characters
for how much count is. Since buffer does not contain anything
else after the newline \n, the system pulls in letters
from memory, as many as how many more characters are in count


//number 11
I would use a C library function when I am changing a program that can work on any OS. So if I wanted to change Microsoft Word, I would use the C Library functions

For an OS system call, that would be when I want to make changes to the 
OS that can also affect hardware and the kernel. A situation would be if I wanted 
to adjust the time zone of the OS or change the OS settings.
