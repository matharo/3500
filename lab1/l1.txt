4. It is faster to make a few system calls that read meany characters
because in order to do system calls, you need a control transfer from user 
space to kernel space. In orer to do that, you need an interrupt. This interrupt will
transfer control to kernel. With fewer system calls, there are fewer interrupts,
so it is faster.
