3. pipefd[0] is the read end of the pipe. pipefd[1] is the write end of the pipe. 

4. The second argument, newfd gets closed and returned when the dup2 function succeeds.

5. 
pid_t child_one = fork();
        if (child_one == 0){
                dup2(pipefd[1],STDOUT_FILENO);
pid_t child_two = fork();
        if (child_two == 0){
                dup2(pipefd[0],STDIN_FILENO);

8. Two advantages:
	1. you do not need to create even more processes solely for specifically acting on a specific file/anything.
	2. save data/space on the number of processes that are needed because a few general ones that can act on everything is the most efficient
