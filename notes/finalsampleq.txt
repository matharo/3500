2)
how many page frames?
2^21/2^11 = 2^10 = 1024 page frames

how many pages can each process access?
2^21 bytes/2^11 bytes/page = 2^10 pages

suppose process accesses virt. addr 9000
what page does this access, what offset?

page size = 2048
page 0 = 0-2047
page 1 = 2048-4095
page 2 = 4096-6143
page 3 = 6144-8191
page 4 = 8192-10239

it access page 4, offset = 808


3)

better way to implement
both go one place, organize/sort messages based on urgency

solve problems? no
bad thing can happen: messages can get stuck, can still interfere
	need to wait between urgent and non urgent

multiple threads
2 threads, one nonurgent one urgent
have any delays be passed on and handled by other thread
